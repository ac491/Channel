# channel

Channel, our idea is to create a platform where a writer can have full autonomy and creative freedom to provide their quality content to the masses . Channel taps into the brains of the worldâ€™s most insightful writers, thinkers, and storytellers to bring you the smartest takes on topics that matter. So whatever your interest, you can always find fresh thinking and unique perspectives.

We are implementing it as a part of the course CSD402: Internet and Web Systems.
